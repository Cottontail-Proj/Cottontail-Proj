`Cottontail` is a cutting-edge concolic execution engine powered by large language models (LLMs), designed for highly structured test input generation. Presented at <a href="https://sp2026.ieee-security.org/">IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P) 2026</a>, `Cottontail` advances the state-of-the-art in automated software testing by integrating expressive program path representation, LLM-driven constraint solving, and history-guided seed acquisition.

(A fun fact: the logo of `Cottontail` is generated by Google Gemini :grinning:).


## Features

- **Expressive Coverage Tree (ECT):** A high-level representation of structural program paths to help structure-aware path constraint selection for comprehensive program analysis.
- **LLM-Driven Constraint Solver:** Smartly solves path constraints to generate syntactically valid and path-constraint satisfiable test inputs.
- **History-Guided Seed Acquisition:** Efficiently discovers new, highly structured test inputs to maximize coverage, based on the naming convention of the functions.
- **Sound Analysis:** All test cases from LLM are validated to ensure that the resulting behaviors are sound, consistent with the underlying principles of concolic execution.
